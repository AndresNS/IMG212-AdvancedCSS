                            <h4>Description</h4>
                            <p>Magic: The Gathering is a collectible card game of strategy, skill, cool cards and
                                dueling wizards. As a player, you have to use your cards to fight battles with orcs,
                                elves, dragons, serpents, etc. to see who is the strongest wizard. This is the
                                grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.</p>
                            <p>There are five colors: white, blue, black, red, and green; each one signifies an
                                ideological faction, whose culture defines the flavor and gameplay of its cards, as well
                                as its relations with the other colors. Each color has its own means and motivation for
                                doing battle in Magic, which tie into its strengths, weaknesses, and unique mechanics.

                            <h4>White</h4>
                            <p>In the Magic world, white is the color of law, order, and structure. It can stop an
                                attacking creature in its tracks by making it see the error of its ways. White magic
                                heals and protects creatures.</p>
                            <p>Mages that use white mana prefer to send an army of smaller creatures into battle, but
                                sometimes a single, awesome champion is necessary to teach the enemy a lesson.</p>

                            <h4>Blue</h4>
                            <p>The strength of blue magic lies in trickery and manipulation. Blue mages work behind the
                                scenes, scheming and stealing secrets, controlling their environments completely before
                                making a move.</p>
                            <p>Blue spells and abilities focus on "borrowing" opponents' cards and drawing the right
                                card at the right time. With the power of blue, call wizards and weird beasts of the air
                                and oceans to serve you.</p>

                            <h4>Black</h4>
                            <p>Death, disease, selfishness, power at any cost-these are the twisted values of the
                                darkness. Black magic is powerful and easy to wield, but it comes with a high price. Its
                                spells and abilities can warp the mind, poison the land, and turn creatures into
                                nothing.</p>
                            <p>Dark minions, undead creatures, and unspeakable horrors are native to the swamp, and
                                they're as self-serving and treacherous as the mages who command them.</p>

                            <h4>Red</h4>
                            <p>Red magic is filled with fire, frenzy, and storms of rock and lava. Its creatures are
                                warlike and dangerous, ranging from mighty dragons to hordes of rampaging goblins.</p>
                            <p>Mages who master red magic have no patience for talk or subtlety. They act quickly and
                                recklessly. Red mages can channel their wild emotions to crush the ground you walk on or
                                to wield flame like a living weapon.</p>

                            <h4>Green</h4>
                            <p>Green magic is about growth, life, and brute force. Green mages understand that the world
                                obeys the law of the jungle-everything is either predator or prey.</p>
                            <p>Some green creatures are rich, living sources of mana, but no other color can boast
                                creatures as powerful. Green creatures are the biggest and mightiest around, from
                                towering nature elementals to carnivorous wurms.</p>
