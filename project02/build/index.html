            <p>Magic: The Gathering is a collectible card game of strategy, skill, cool cards and dueling wizards. As a
                player, you have to use your cards to fight battles with orcs, elves, dragons, serpents, etc. to see who
                is the strongest wizard. This is the grandfather of the collectible card game (or CCG) genre.</p>
            <p>There are five colors: white, blue, black, red, and green; each one signifies an ideological faction,
                whose culture defines the flavor and gameplay of its cards, as well as its relations with the other
                colors. Each color has its own means and motivation for doing battle in Magic, which tie into its
                strengths, weaknesses, and unique mechanics.</p>

                <h2>White</h2>
                <p>White puts value in the group, the community, and its civilization as a whole. White believes that
                    suffering is a by-product of individuals not prioritizing the good of the group. White's ultimate
                    goal is peace — a world where there is no unnecessary suffering, a world where life is as good as it
                    can be for each individual, a world where everyone gets along and no one seeks to disturb the bonds
                    of unity that White had worked so long to forge.</p>
                <p>To govern and protect its community, White makes use of and puts value in a number of broad concepts;
                    morality (ethics, grace, truth), order (law, discipline, duty), uniformity (conformity, religion),
                    and structure (government, planning, reason).</p>
                <p>White is a color ommonly associated with good and justice, but if left unchecked or if everyone is
                    not working toward the same unified goal, White can become authoritarian, inflexible, and capable of
                    sacrificing a small group for the sake of a larger one. Everything necessary to preserve the laws,
                    rules, and governance that White created.</p>

                <h2>Blue</h2>
                <p>Blue is the color that wants perfection and looks on the world and sees opportunity to achieve that,
                    figuring out what you could achieve with the right education, experience, and tools. For Blue, life
                    is one of constant discovery as you keep seeking to better yourself.</p>
                <p>This way of living requires the right attitude. You have to be open to possibilities, but also not
                    too hasty in action. Blue is methodical and exact and recognizes that there are many forces, even
                    some that come from within, that lead an individual astray. It is better to think one's options out
                    carefully and select correctly than to rush to a decision. Implicitly, in that general world view,
                    blue believes in tabula rasa: every one of us is born a blank slate with the potential to become
                    anything. One need only understand how, to make the change. So with this ill-formed goal before it,
                    Blue reasons that if it is to make itself better, it must become capable of everything it could be
                    capable of, for that is to "merely add" to its own capabilities. Blue believes it can't possibly be
                    bad to acquire the potential for any conscious action. Thus, Blue, believing it is capable of
                    changing anything if it understands the change, and believing it is imperative that it acquire every
                    capability it could have, concludes that it is imperative that it understand change.</p>
                <p>As such, blue is the color most interested in technology and wants the latest and greatest version of
                    whatever it is using. Moreover, blue decides that it must understand everything; for truly,
                    understanding can only improve one's effectiveness in any task. To gain understanding, blue must
                    acquire knowledge. Since knowledge itself will inform every other decision, blue forms its principle
                    goal: omniscience, the knowledge of all.</p>

                <h2>Black</h2>
                <p>Black doesn't see anything as fundamentally immoral. To black, the only measure of right and wrong
                    should be whether or not it leads to success. Black is open to opportunities and strategies rejected
                    by others as taboo or forbidden—death, torment, infection, betrayal. Black characters will do
                    anything to ensure their own well-being even at the expense of others; to black, anything less only
                    allows others to do the same. Thus, black does everything possible to gain the only commodity that
                    can secure it from weakness, and ensure its ability to get whatever it needs or wants—power.</p>
                <p> Although if taken to extremes, black's selfishness and lack of ethical restraint can result in
                    tragedy, at its most basic level black is not inherently evil. It has a very cynical world view, and
                    its core philosophy is that of self-determination and release from society-imposed limitations.</p>
                <p>Black has an ally in blue, as it appreciates its subtlety and use of cold logic. Black is also allied
                    with red, respecting its desire to do things on its own terms. However, black's disregard for other
                    members of the group, spirituality/religion, and the sanctity of life opposes it with green and
                    white.</p>

                <h2>Red</h2>
                <p>Above all else, Red values freedom. It wants to do what it wants, when it wants, to whom it wants,
                    and nobody can tell it otherwise. In summary, Red thinks that all you have to do is listen to your
                    heart and simply act accordingly, letting your emotions guide you. Red loves life much more than any
                    other color and so it believes that all people must live to its fullest. Red believes that life is
                    an adventure, that it would be much more fun if everyone stopped caring about rules, laws, and
                    personal appearances and just spent their time indulging their desires through experience.</p>
                <p>Red doesn't live its life questioning choices it has made, and lives in the moment; Red is
                    spontaneous and embraces every adventure put before it. Red is the color of immediate action and
                    immediate gratification. If it wants something, it will act on its impulses and take it, regardless
                    of the consequences. Red embraces relationships and knows passion and loyalty and camaraderie and
                    lust. When Red bonds with another, it bonds strongly and fiercely.</p>
                <p>To outsiders, Red might seem a bit chaotic; that's only because others can't see what's in red's
                    heart. Red sees order of any kind as pointlessly inhibiting, believing that only through embracing
                    anarchy could everyone really be free to enjoy life to the fullest with no regrets.</p>

            <div class="media__body width-80">
                <h2>Green</h2>
                <p>Green doesn't want to change the world, it wants everybody to accept the world as it is. Green is
                    convinced that the world already got everything right. Green tries to coexist with it instead of
                    trying to change it, regulate it, norm it, or take advantage of it.</p>
                <p>Green is the color of nature and interdependence. It believes that the natural order is a thing of
                    beauty and has all the answers to life's problems, that obeying the natural order alone is the best
                    way to exist and thus favors a simplistic way of living in harmony with the rest of the world. This
                    can often lead to it being perceived as a pacifistic color, as it does not seek to make conflict
                    with the other colors as long as they leave it alone and do not disrespect nature. However, it is
                    fierce when it feels threatened and can be predatory and aggressive if its instincts dictate.</p>
                <p>Green believes each individual is born with all the potential they need, that it's imprinted in its
                    genes. That everyone was born with a role and that the goal is to recognize it and then embrace it,
                    and thus do what they were destined to do. But that role interconnects with the web of life, and
                    thus everyone has to learn how you fit into the larger picture. We are not alone, we are a part of a
                    complex system full of interdependency. Green truly believes that every individual has to bother to
                    sit back and understand the bigger picture and don't get so caught up in the details of their lives.
